# sbeam — Completed Development

This file is the authoritative record of all completed development steps, key decisions made
during implementation, and resolved defects. It is updated as part of every session that
completes a step — never deferred.

---

## Principles

- Each step produces working, testable code before the next step begins.
- Steps are small enough to complete and verify in a single session.
- Every step that adds solver logic must have an analytical verification case.
- The viewer is developed in parallel with the solver — each solver step has a corresponding display step.
- Documentation is updated as part of each step, not after.
- **The Streamlit viewer (`viewer/app.py`) is the primary entry point for all interactive use.** The CLI (`main.py`) is a secondary, batch-mode interface for automation and headless runs.

---

## Phase 1 — Project Setup

### Step 1: Repository and Project Skeleton ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Establish the directory structure, dependencies, and empty module files so all subsequent steps have a consistent layout to build into.

**Deliverables:**
- `sbeam/` directory tree matching `docs/sbeam.md` module structure (empty `__init__.py` files, placeholder modules)
- `requirements.txt` (numpy, scipy, pandas, plotly, streamlit)
- `tests/` directory mirroring `sbeam/` structure
- `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` test configuration

**Note on `main.py`:** This is a thin CLI wrapper (`python main.py run.bdf`) that reads a run file via `parse_bdf()`, dispatches to the appropriate solver, and writes a `.f06`. Left as a placeholder stub until after the solver and viewer are complete — it adds no new logic.

**Test / Acceptance:**
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` completes without error.
- `pytest tests/` runs and reports "no tests collected" (not an error).
- `python -c "import sbeam"` succeeds.

---

## Phase 2 — BDF Parser

### Step 2: Data Model — BDF Card Dataclasses ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Define Python dataclasses for all Phase 1 BDF cards.

**Deliverables:**
- `model/grid.py` — `Grid` dataclass (gid, x, y, z, ps)
- `model/element.py` — `Cbar`, `Plotel`, `Rbe3` dataclasses
- `model/property.py` — `Pbar` dataclass (pid, mid, A, I1, I2, J, NSM, recovery points)
- `model/material.py` — `Mat1` dataclass (mid, E, G, nu, rho)
- `model/load.py` — `Force`, `Moment`, `Load` dataclasses
- `model/constraint.py` — `Spc`, `Spc1` dataclasses
- `model/mass.py` — `Conm2` dataclass
- `model/bulk_data.py` — `BulkData` container dataclass
- `parser/case_control.py` — `SubcaseControl`, `CaseControl` dataclasses

---

### Step 3: Parser — Geometry and Properties ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Read GRID, PBAR, MAT1 cards from a bulk data section into a `BulkData` object.

**Deliverables:**
- `parser/bdf_reader.py` — free-field and fixed-field BDF line parsing; `GRID`, `PBAR`, `MAT1` card handlers.
- `tests/parser/test_geometry.py`

**Test / Acceptance:**
- Parse a hand-written 3-node, 2-element BDF snippet. Verify GIDs, coordinates, property, and material values match input exactly.

- Unknown card issues `warnings.warn` and is skipped.

---

### Step 4: Parser — Elements ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Add CBAR, PLOTEL, and CONM2 card parsing.

**Deliverables:**
- `bdf_reader.py` extended with `CBAR`, `PLOTEL`, `CONM2` handlers (including orientation vector X1/X2/X3 and pin flags PA/PB).
- `tests/parser/test_elements.py`

**Test / Acceptance:**
- Parse a cantilever model BDF (5 CBAR elements); verify EIDs, GA/GB, PID, orientation vector, and pin flags.
- CBAR referencing a non-existent GRID raises `ValueError`.
- CBAR referencing a non-existent PID raises `ValueError`.
- More than 200 CBAR elements raises `ValueError`.

---

- `tests/parser/test_loads.py`

**Test / Acceptance:**
- Parse a model with two load sets, one SPC set, and an EIGRL. Verify all SIDs and values.
- LOAD card referencing a non-existent component SID raises `ValueError`.
- DOF string "0" (invalid) raises `ValueError`.

---

### Step 6: Parser — Case Control and INCLUDE ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Parse the case control section (above `BEGIN BULK`) and the `INCLUDE` statement for the bulk data file. Also add a bulk-data-only loader.

**Deliverables:**
- `parser/case_control.py` — parser for `SOL`, `SUBCASE`, `LOAD`, `SPC`, `METHOD`, output request cards, `INCLUDE`.
- `bdf_reader.py` — `parse_bdf(filepath)` top-level function.
- `bdf_reader.py` — `parse_bulk_file(filepath)` function: reads a bulk-data-only file, returns `BulkData`.

The two top-level functions serve distinct use cases:

| Function | Input | Returns | Requires SOL |
|----------|-------|---------|--------------|
| `parse_bdf(filepath)` | Run file with case control | `(CaseControl, BulkData)` | Yes — raises `ValueError` |
| `parse_bulk_file(filepath)` | Bulk-data file (`.dat` or `.bdf`) | `BulkData` | No |

| ID | Model | SOL | Check | Tolerance |
|----|-------|-----|-------|-----------|
| V1 | Cantilever, tip load P | 101 | Tip deflection = PL³/3EI | < 0.1% |
| V2 | Cantilever, tip load P | 101 | Fixed-end moment = PL | < 0.1% |
| V3 | Simply supported, mid-span load | 101 | Mid deflection = PL³/48EI | < 0.1% |

---

## Phase 2 Model Enhancements (completed items)

### Step 32: Local Coordinate Systems — CORD2R ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Support user-defined rectangular coordinate systems for grid input, load application, CONM2 offset/inertia, and results output. Only `CORD2R` is implemented. All internal computations remain in global CID 0; coordinate transforms apply at the input and output boundaries.

**Deliverables:**
- `model/coordinate_system.py` — `Cord2r` dataclass (`cid`, `rid`, `a`, `b`, `c`).
- `model/bulk_data.py` — `cord2rs: dict[int, Cord2r]` field added.
- `model/grid.py` — `cp: int` and `cd: int` fields added (default 0).
- `assembly/coord_transform.py` — `build_transform(cid, cord2rs) → R (3×3)`, `to_global`, `to_local`, `resolve_grid_positions(bulk)`.
- `parser/bdf_reader.py` — `CORD2R` handler (continuation required); `GRID` now reads CP and CD; `_is_continuation` updated to also accept unnamed (blank first-field) continuations; `resolve_grid_positions` called after all cards are parsed.
- `assembly/load_vector.py` — FORCE/MOMENT direction vectors rotated from CID → global before assembly.
- `assembly/mass_matrix.py` — CONM2 offset vector and inertia tensor rotated from CID → global before assembly (`R @ r`, `R @ I @ Rᵀ`).
- `results/f06_writer.py` — nodal displacements/reactions and mode shapes rotated from global into each grid's CD frame before output.

**Verification cases:**

| ID | Description | Check |
|----|-------------|-------|
| V-CS1 | Cantilever grids defined in 90°-rotated CP, tip load global | Tip deflection matches all-global model ± 0.1% |
| V-CS2 | FORCE applied in rotated CID | Load vector DOFs match equivalent global FORCE |
| V-CS3 | Grid CD ≠ 0 (90°-rotated) | Displacement output in CD frame matches hand-rotated global values |
| V-CS4 | Two chained CORD2R systems | Grid position in global matches analytical result |
| V-CS5 | 10-element cantilever defined in rotated CP | f₁ matches same model in global frame ± 1% |

**Scope — out of scope:** CORD2C, CORD2S, CORD1R. CBAR orientation vector already specified in global frame per NASTRAN convention.

---

### Step 36: RBE2 — Rigid Element ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Support the `RBE2` rigid element connecting a single independent grid to one or more dependent grids with fully rigid (or DOF-selective) coupling.

**Scope:**
- `RBE2` card: EID, GN (independent grid), CM (coupled DOF string), GM1, GM2, … (dependent grids).
- Implemented via the same DOF transformation approach used for RBE3 (`assembly/rbe3.py`): each dependent DOF in CM is constrained to equal the corresponding DOF at GN.
- Works in both SOL 101 and SOL 103.
- Viewer: display RBE2 connections as solid red lines from GN to each GM (distinct from RBE3 dashed).

---

### Step 37: CBUSH — Spring and Damper Element ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Implement the `CBUSH` generalised spring-damper element and its associated `PBUSH` property card, enabling stiffness connections in up to 6 independent DOFs.

**Scope:**
- `CBUSH` card: EID, PID, GA, GB (blank = grounded at GA), X1/X2/X3 orientation vector. CID=0 (global system) only. Offset fields not supported in Phase 2.
- `PBUSH` card: PID, K1–K6 stiffness values. Viscous damping B1–B6 deferred to dynamic solvers.
- Stiffness matrix: 6×6 diagonal local matrix `diag(K1, K2, K3, K4, K5, K6)`. Assembled into 12×12 two-node element matrix. For grounded element (GB blank), 6×6 at GA only.
- CBUSH is massless; CONM2 remains the mass source.
- Works in SOL 101 and SOL 103.

**Deliverables:**
- `model/element.py` — `Cbush` dataclass (eid, pid, ga, gb, x).
- `model/property.py` — `Pbush` dataclass (pid, k[6]).
- `model/bulk_data.py` — `cbushs: dict[int, Cbush]` and `pbushs: dict[int, Pbush]`.
- `assembly/stiffness.py` — `cbush_stiffness_global(cbush, grids, pbushs)`; `assemble_global_stiffness` extended to include CBUSH.
- `solver/sol101.py` — `recover_cbush_forces(bulk, u_full)` returning `dict[eid, np.ndarray(6)]`.
- `results/results.py` — `cbush_forces: dict[int, np.ndarray]` added to `Sol101Result`.
- `results/f06_writer.py` — "CBUSH ELEMENT FORCES" table section in SOL 101 output.
- `viewer/geometry.py` — render CBUSH as a zigzag (spring-coil) polyline between GA and GB.

---

## Resolved Defects

### B3: Solver — Multi-Subcase ✅ FIXED

**Objective:** Both `run_sol101` and `run_sol103` silently used only `case_control.subcases[0]`. Fixed to support any number of subcases.

**Changes made:**
- `sbeam/solver/sol101.py` — `run_sol101` signature changed from `(bulk, case_control)` to `(bulk, subcase: SubcaseControl)`. Accepts one subcase at a time; caller is responsible for looping.
- `sbeam/solver/sol103.py` — same signature change for `run_sol103`.
- `sbeam/viewer/app.py` — `_run_analysis` now loops over `cc.subcases`, collecting `dict[subcase_id, Sol101Result]` / `dict[subcase_id, Sol103Result]` stored in session state.
- `sbeam/viewer/results_view.py` — `render_sol101_results` and `render_sol103_results` updated to accept result dicts; a "Subcase" selectbox is shown when more than one subcase is present. `load_sid` for the active subcase is looked up from `st.session_state.case_control`.
- All test call sites updated: `run_sol101(bulk, cc)` → `run_sol101(bulk, cc.subcases[0])` across 7 test files.

**Acceptance test:** `tests/integration/test_verification.py::TestB3MultiSubcase` — 2-subcase cantilever with loads P and 2P; asserts each subcase produces the correct closed-form tip deflection and that the results are independent (2:1 ratio).

**Key decision:** Solvers are now single-subcase functions; the caller (viewer or test) loops over subcases. This is simpler and more composable than making the solver loop internally.

---

### B2: Viewer — Results Display ✅ FIXED

Deformed-node trace in `build_deformed_figure` now carries `customdata=[gid, Tx, Ty, Tz]` and a `hovertemplate` showing raw physical displacements. Hover no longer shows scaled coordinates.
